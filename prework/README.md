# Welcome to Front-End Engineering!

The following is the pre-work for the Front-End Engineering class. The more you do, the more
you'll get out of the cohort. Do not skip this vital step!

Go through this pre-work and turn in the [pre-work survey](http://goo.gl/forms/Yzj7Xh5BvH)
by *May 13th*. We look forward to seeing you all in class!

## Set up your Mac

1. [Install Atom](https://atom.io/)
2. [Install Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
3. [Install Node](http://nodejs.org/download/)
4. [Install Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)
5. [Install Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
6. [Sign up for GitHub](https://github.com/)

## Back to Basics (Optional)

If you're brand new to Mac OS, you're probably already getting a bit confused by the differences in conventions and crazy symbols. _Don't Panic!_ There's [a great support article on Apple.com called _Mac Basics_](https://www.apple.com/support/macbasics/) to get you started. Regardless of how good you think you are at typing, a lot of the mistakes you make at first will be simple typographic errors. If you _don't_ know how to touch type (i.e. without looking at the keyboard), start practicing _now_ with [keybr](http://www.keybr.com/). If you're fairly confident in your typing ability, try working through the JavaScript lessons on [typing.io](http://typing.io).

## GitHubbing to Know You

If you haven't already, [create a GitHub account](http://github.com/signup) (or use your existing one) and [edit your GitHub profile](https://github.com/settings/profile). Add a _recent, clear picture_ so we can recognize your face, _your full name_ so we can recognize your name, _a valid public email address_ so we can contact you. Then, _star the class syllabus repo_.

### Send all my GitHub to you...

GitHub is a tool we'll use very heavily in the class and is highly respected in the industry. Learn all you can about `git` -- the command -- and GitHub! There are [some helpful Guides on GitHub](http://guides.github.com) to help you get started, but start with [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and [Fork-and-Spoon](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

## Command Line Training

In this class, we're going to use the Command Line Interface (CLI) _a lot_. Start with [_An Intro to the OS X Command Line_](http://eddywashere.com/blog/an-intro-to-the-os-x-command-line/) and [_Learn the Command Line_ on CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/). If you're looking for more of a challenge, you can try the [_CLI Crash Course_ by Zed Shaw](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/).

## Learn the front-end languages

Come up with a schedule for yourself-- maybe 30 minutes/an hour per day-- to
spend reading about and exploring the following subjects.

### HTML and CSS

- [Learn HTML and CSS basics](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/).
- [Play with HTML/CSS in Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web)

### JavaScript

Learn JavaScript by going through the free
[Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) book. Complete chapters 1 - 5. Anything beyond that is *great* but not necessary for
pre-work.

Be sure to [complete Beginning JavaScript in Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript) as well.
